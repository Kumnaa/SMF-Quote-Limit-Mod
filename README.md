SMF-Quote-Limit-Mod
===================

Quote limiting modification for the SMF forum software.

This mod simply stops the number of quotes within quotes from getting out of hand.

Simply install and setup the number of embedded quotes from the Miscellaneous Modification settings page in the admin panel.

Thanks to Darkmantle for starting this off.
